## :bar_chart: Background

**February 19, 2020**, 
marked the stock market peak before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ever since February 2022, Covid-19 has spread across the entire world and
it has dramatically impacted the economic landscape and the financial markets in almost
every country. In this project, I am going to analyze quantitatively, how Covid-19 has impacted
the the stock markets from 3 different economies: United States, European Union and China. The chosen
market indices are as follows: 

- **S&P500**: abbreviation for Standard and Poor's 500, a stock market index that tracks 500 publicly traded companies in United States
- **FTSE 100**: Financial Times Stock Exchange Index that consists of the share of the 100 biggest companies by market capitalisation on the London Stock Exchange(LSE)
- **HSI**: Hang Seng Index, a market capitalization-weighted index of the largest companies that trade on the HongKong Stock Market Exchange

**Additionally**, I am interested in finding out how Covid-19 impact the stock markets from the developed economies and the emerging economies. Therefore, a quantitative analysis
will be conducted on the two indices below:

- **MSCI Developed(^XWD.TO)**: a global investable market index that measures stock market performance from developed economies
- **MSCI Emerging(^XEM.TO)**: an index that captures large and mid-cap listed companies across 24 Emerging Market countries

**Additionally**, an analysis for Costco stock price will be conducted. Key financial numbers such as ROE, P/E Ratio will be gathered for fundemental analysis. 
Quantitative analysis with regression analysis and machine learning techniques will also be carried out.
